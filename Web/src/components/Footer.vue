                This is all in jest. 
                <br />
                <br />
                JimBook™ International is a wholly owned subsidiary of Abercrombie and Fitch™. We don't know why.
                <br />
                <br />
                JimBook™ International is really only in the USA.
                <br />
                <br />
                JimBook™ USA is really only in Ohio.

                Thank you for coming to my Lunch and Learn™ on an almost entirely unrelated topic.
